## Mod4 Prework

Hi there! I did the following additional things

- Add JS file with a darkMode toggle button using a nifty little invert trick I learned over break

- Created a JSON dataset and referenced that file elsewhere, loaded it to the server, and then send it requests. (it's obnoxious, don't look at it)

- added a 404 catch all response
